### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Order` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete c/1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete c/1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCustomerCommand` and `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Order` and `Product` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, an `OrderList` and a `MenuList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Order` and `Product` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<Order>` and `ObservableList<Product>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* can save completed order data in CSV format.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `CompletedOrderStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any of the three (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Removing order feature

#### Implementation

Removes an `Order` from the `OrderList` by its index. Example: `cancel 19`.
The sequence of events is illustrated by the diagram below, starting with parsing of the command.
![CancelSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/CancelSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)
![CancelSequenceDiagram-Model](images/CancelSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

After parsing the `cancel` command, the `LogicManager` will call the `Model#deleteOrder(id)` which calls
`AddressBook#deleteOrder(id)`. The `Order` instance will then call its own `removeOrder(id)` which will remove this order from the customer's `ArrayList<Order>`.

### Find customer or order feature

#### Implementation

![FindCommandClassDiagram](images/FindCommandClassDiagram.png)

`FindOrderCommand` and `FindPersonCommand` extends the `FindCommand` abstract class. The `PREFIX_ORDER` after the `find` command will create a `FindOrderCommand` while any other valid prefixes will create a `FindPersonCommand`.

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

`FindCommandParser` will construct the respective command with the relevant predicates.
1. If `PREFIX_ORDER`, a `FindOrderCommand` with a `MatchingOrderIndexPredicate` will be created.
2. If `PREFIX_NAME`, a `FindPersonCommand` with a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be created.
3. If `PREFIX_EMAIL`, a `FindPersonCommand` with a `MatchingEmailPredicate` will be created.
4. If `PREFIX_PHONE`, a `FindPersonCommand` with a `MatchingPhonePredicate` will be created.
5. If `PREFIX_ADDRESS`, a `FindPersonCommand` with a `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be created.

The `Predicate` will then be used to filter the list using `stream()`. The updated `FilteredOrderList` will then be reflected in the GUI.

### Add a product to menu feature

#### Implementation

Adds a `Product` to the menu. Example: `menu pn/Cupcake pc/2.50 ps/5`. The sequence of events are illustrated by the diagram below, starting with the parsing of the command.

![AddMenuCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddMenuSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

The `AddMenuCommand` class which extends the `Command` abstract class will be executed by the `LogicManager` which will update the `Product Menu` in the `Model`.

![AddMenuCommandModelDiagram](images/AddMenuSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

After parsing the `menu` command, the `LogicManager` will call the `Model#addProduct(id)` which calls `AddressBook#addProduct(id)`. The `addProduct` of `ProductMenu` will then be called, which will add a new product to the `ArrayList<Product>`.

### Delete a product from menu feature

#### Implementation

Deletes a `Product` from the menu. Example: `delete m/1`. The sequence of events are illustrated by the diagram below, starting with the parsing of the command.

![DeleteMenuCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteMenuSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

The `DeleteMenuCommand` class which extends the `Command` abstract class will be executed by the `LogicManager` which will update the `Product Menu` in the `Model`.

![DeleteMenuCommandModelDiagram](images/DeleteMenuSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

After parsing the `menu` command, the `LogicManager` will call the `Model#deleteProduct(id)` which calls `AddressBook#deleteProduct(id)`. The `deleteProduct` of `ProductMenu` will then be called, which deletes a product from the `ArrayList<Product` according to the specified `MENU_ID`.

`DeleteCommandParser` will construct the respective command based on the accompanying prefixes:
1. If `PREFIX_MENU`, a `DeleteMenuCommand` will be created.
2. If `PREFIX_CUSTOMER_ID`, a `DeleteCustomerCommand` will be created.

### Edit a product in the menu feature

#### Implementation

Edits a `Product` on the menu. Example: `edit m/1 pn/Pie`. The `edit` command works in a similar way as the `delete` command.

`EditCommandParser` will construct the respective command based on the accompanying prefixes:
1. If `PREFIX_MENU`, a `EditMenuCommand` will be created.
2. If `PREFIX_CUSTOMER_ID`, a `EditCustomerCommand` will be created.
3. If `PREFIX_ORDER_ID`, an `EditOrderCommand` will be created.

### Stage order feature

#### Implementation

Moves an order to the next stage, in the chain of the four stages, in order namely: `Under Preparation`, `Ready for Delivery`,
`Sent for delivery` and `Received by customer`. However, you cannot go back to a previous stage.

Example: `stage o/1`

The sequence of events are illustrated by the diagram below, starting with the parsing of the command.
![StageCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/StageCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

The `StageCommand` class which extends the `Command` abstract class will be executed by the `LogicManager` which will update the `addressBook` in the `Model`.
![StageCommandSequenceDiagram-Model](images/StageCommandSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

### Known Limitations
1. As `StringUtil#containsWordIgnoreCase` searches by entire word, searching for `945` in `94567122` for `Phone` will result in false. This is also consistent in `Email`.

2. Only one `PREFIX` can be chosen to filter by. Future improvements may include searching from more than one `PREFIX`. Example: `find o/19 n/John a/Lorong`.

### Completing Order Feature

#### Implementation

Data archiving of completed orders is achieved by creating a `CompleteOrderCommand` with the user input, Example `complete 1`
, which will remove the order from the active order list and place it in a completed order list which will be saved as a csv file.
![CompleteCommandLogicSequenceDiagram](images/CompleteSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)
The `CompleteCommand` class which extends the `Command` abstract class will be executed by the `LogicManager` which will
update the Active Order List and Completed Order List in the `Model`.
This is done by placing the completed `Order` in the completed order list to be collected by the `StorageManager` in the
next step.
![CompleteCommandModelSequenceDiagram](images/CompleteSequenceDiagram-Model.png)
The StorageManager will then store the Orders inside of the Completed Order List as a csv file in this directory: 
`[JAR file location]/data/completedorders.csv`, compiling all previously completed orders.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Home-Based Food Business Owners who sell their products online
* has a need to manage a significant number of customer contacts
* has a need to track the food order to the contact
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: The address book can help homemade food sellers organize customer information and orders
so that they know what to bake, how much to bake and where to deliver the order to. This information management
tool aims to be more efficient to use than paper-work or general-purpose excel sheets. We also aim to reduce
chances of mistakes such as wrong delivery address, forgetting an order or sending repeated orders.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 10000 contacts and 500 active orders without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Even when the app quits unexpectedly in run time, most information updated in the current session should not be lost when the app re-launches.
5.  Should protect sensitive customer information so that they are not leaked to possible malware on the same device.
6.  The user interface should look clean and organised even when it is populated with a lot of information.
7.  The response time to any action other than fetching archived order history should be within 1 second.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Sensitive customer information**: Customer's name, email, phone number, address and any other personal information which is saved locally in this app

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 5
### Limit input of cost and sales
* Currently, the input of cost and sales of product can be negative, or very high until Infinity is reached.
* Future plans is to add boundaries and limit the pricing to be between 0 inclusive and 1 billion.

### Limit Phone number
* Currently, the phone number is minimally of length 3.
* As this product is created mainly for Singaporeans, future enhancement is to increase limit to 8, which is the norm in
Singapore. This will prevent errors where phone number of length 7 is entered but gone unnoticed.

### Allow duplicate customer names
* Currently, customers entered cannot have the same name. However, most commands are either done with phone number or
CUSTOMER_ID, future plans would allow for duplicate customer names.

### Restrict deadline dates to be after creation date
* Currently, deadline dates can be set to be before order creation date. Future plans will fix so that it can only be
after.

### Allow customer names to contain slash and other legal non-alphanumeric characters
* Currently, sequence of characters like s/o is not allowed as a valid input. Future tweaks will allow for more
flexibility in names.

### Allow text-wrapping when characters are too long
* Currently, when certain values are too long like product names, text will overflow out of the app instead of going to
a new line. Future fixes will allow text-wrapping into a new line.

### Disallow duplicate phone numbers for different customers
* Currently, duplicate phone numbers is not checked for. If different customers share a phone number, order from that
phone number will be added to the first customer in the contact list.
* In the future, we will check phone number against existing contact list when adding new customers, so as to remove such ambiguities.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Being the first delve into team-based software engineering for many of us in the group, the difficulty
level for our project was relatively high. This was one of the many factors that made the difficulty much 
higher than expected.

Another major challenge was overambition. For many of us, we went into CS2103 without seeking any tips and
advice from our peers and seniors. This led to us being unable to compare and judge the estimated effort 
other groups and batches put in. This led to us over estimating our ability to organise and implement a
large number of complex features. This is especially so when we consider the busy
schedule of everyone in the group.

Another major hurdle for our group is coordination and communication. Having to create many functions and
classes that have co-dependecies with each other. It was quite challenging to incorporate elements of each
others code as many of our features rely on each other to work correctly and efficiently. Sometimes,
we required each other's guidance to help understand the how their code will work with our own code and how to
incorporate it into other features and to ensure that all the traits a customer,order or product
should have are properly updated, deleted and added.

Despite the hurdles and challenges faced, we all put in extra effort and time despite our busy schedules to 
hold meetings, review others' code and comment on how we could improve our designs.

Glad to say, we have achieved more than what we expected, we were able to implement most of the features we 
wanted for the entire project in v1.2. We then came up with new features to further improve Strack that 
were outside our original set of features. After all of that, we could say that we were proud of the end product
and effort that we put into this project.
